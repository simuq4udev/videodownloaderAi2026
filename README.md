# VideoDownloader (Android, Kotlin)

Market-standard starter project for a **policy-compliant** video downloader. The app only allows downloads from **direct HTTPS URLs** and **blocks common social media domains** to align with platform policies and content rights.

## ✅ Compliance Principles
- **User rights confirmation** required before download.
- **Social media domains blocked** (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.).
- **No circumvention** of DRM or platform restrictions.
- **Direct URLs only** (e.g., your own CDN or storage bucket).

## ✅ Features
- Clean single-activity UI (Material Components).
- DownloadManager integration.
- Status messaging for compliance and errors.

## ✅ Build & Run
1. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
2. Sync Gradle.
3. Run on a device/emulator (Android 7.0+).

## ✅ Policy Note
This template is designed to comply with Google Play and platform policies by preventing downloads from social media sites and requiring user permission confirmation. It is intended for **content you own or have explicit permission to download**.
